/**
 * Currency rates reducer.
 * The raw state is just a list of currency pairs, each having a
 * `fromCurrency`, `toCurrency`, `rate`, `source`, and `timestamp` field.
 *
 * Based on this raw state, we also derive a map of unique id's.
 * This is used to remove duplicates when we add new pairs to the state.
 * If a new pair has the same identity as an existing pair,
 * we use the mapped index to stomp over the old pair.
 *
 * Finally, we store a routing table, which is is just the pairs list
 * indexed by currency. The routing table has twice as many entries
 * as the pair list, since each pair works both ways.
